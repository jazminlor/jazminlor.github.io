## The Journey Begins!

My journey began at the start of college. I first went to the local community colleges from my hometown, Sacramento, California, for two years. I had my mind set on my major: Computer Science. Originally, I had no idea which field of Computer Science I wanted to be in. I thought of Cybersecurity, but my interests immediately shot down after I found out how challenging it was for me. During my second year, I took a break from Computer Science courses. I knew I wanted to transfer to Hawaiʻi soon, so I only took the general requirement classes in order to avoid taking untransferable major courses. The reason for this? I had just recently found out that I had taken multiple courses at my local campuses that were not required at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, so it was personally a huge waste of time and money.

## The Journey Continues... at UH at Mānoa

When I finally transferred to UH at Mānoa, it was like a reset for me. I was still not taking any courses towards my major due to having my pre-requisites unmet. However, fast foward to the present, I am finally taking Computer Science courses once again! Full disclosure: it is not easy. Although it has only been the first few weeks of my courses, I can admit that I am struggling. I spend almost every day coding and studying for hours on end, yet I often still fall behind. Why do I do it? Why continue? The answer is that I have a genuine love and interest for coding. To me, it is like solving a puzzle. You crack and put all the pieces together until you are left with a completed and solved product. I can also say that although I have a lot of downs, I improve and learn more with each mistake that I make. It gets easier to prevent or learn from my previous mistakes. With my current courses, there has been a lot of teamwork. I have been learning to work with others and trade concepts with one another. It also helps to learn how and why others compute differently.
