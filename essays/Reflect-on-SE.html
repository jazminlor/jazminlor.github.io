  <h2 id="what-i-knew-before-ics-314-software-engineering-i">What I Knew Before ICS 314 (Software Engineering I)</h2>

<p><img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/SE.png" /></p>

<p>Before learning about software engineering and taking the course “ICS 314” at University of Hawai’i at Mānoa, I pretty much had little to no clue on what a Software Engineer does or what skills or tasks it requires. My prior experiences were about theory, algorithms, some coding, and I only knew a select few of coding languages. I had never worked with a team, let alone GitHub. Everything I had done up to that point was solo. I had imagined a software engineer to be someone who codes all day long. I figured they just create new applications and features or they maintained them. Personally, I thought it was all based on either web development or game development too. I also had an idea they worked as a team, but I did not know as to the extent of teamwork it involved.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-software-development">Open Source Software Development</h2>

<p><img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/open-source-technology.jpg" /></p>

<p>In this course, ICS 314, as our final project, we were to create a web application with a given topic and suggested functionality. Once the teams were formed and created, we went to work! Previously, none of us had ever worked on a web application before, let alone in a team. It was a learning experience for all of us. We were first introduced to the concept of “Open Source Software Development”. This means that our code was publicly accessible, viewable, and editable by anyone. For reference, we were using Github to collaborate together. At first, we were all hesitant and thought it was odd and it would be unsafe to leave everything public, but it actually made things a lot better. Think about it; what if someone malicious were to hop on our code and delete or ruin everything? What if someone decided to steal our code? We quickly learned it was okay and that it would be okay, thankfully, because of the functionality of GitHub. On Github, you are able to undo commits, see who has edited exactly what code in which files, and most of all, you can see the user who committed it. There was surprisingly a lot of security on Github!</p>

<p>Once we were finished with milestones, it was also especially helpful that our code and project was completely public. This was essential so that our Professor and peers could look over our work without any hassle. There was no need to sign-in or have exclusive access to every single team’s projects. It was very easy and convenient. Otherwise, if everything was private, or even if just the tasks and issues were private, there was no way of knowing what they were and the status of them. Everyone quickly learned that making your project private turned to be much more of a hassle and risk in the end, because that would mean you would not be able to receive any adequate feedback.</p>

<h2 id="user-interface-frameworks">User Interface Frameworks</h2>

<p><img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/bootstrap-tutorial.png" /></p>

<p>Another concept the entire class was introduced to was using and applying User Interface Frameworks. UI Frameworks sounds exactly like what it means. It is a set of classes and interfaces that defines elements and structures for the user’s view or interface. For example, we were introduced to and used Bootstrap in a lot of our codes. This meant using Bootstrap’s icons, NavBar components, etc. Just simple things that add and that can enhance an application. Depending on what you are trying to build, all these little things are essential for creating a basic application. It also makes the job a whole lot easier and it is way less of a headache!</p>

<h2 id="agile-project-management">Agile Project Management</h2>

<p><img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/Agile-methodology.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Although we had many other concepts introduced to us, I would say that a last key important concept was Agile Project Management. This concept was an approach to planning and guiding a project’s processes. As mentioned earlier, in the final project task, this was one of the keys in achieving our goal. First, we had to discuss the project and give each other’s weaknesses and strengths. This gave us an idea of what our project would look like and who could tackle on various tasks. Next came analysis and strategics. We had mockup pages and references as to what we wanted our application to look like, but we needed ideas as to how we could make this possible.</p>

<p>That is when peer review and attending office hours came into play. Huge props to our Professor! He gave us very many ideas and insights that neither one of us even thought of. For example, he thought of having conditions on items and making it where only users with a “@hawaii.edu” email can create an account. This was because we were really trying to emphasize on the fact that we wanted our web application to be as safe as possible for our students. This was because our concept for our web application was meant for University of Hawai’i students to sell and trade items and goods that they no longer use or need at an affordable price for other students. This web application would benefit both parties.</p>

<p>Our next step after this was execution. Everyone curated and put together their code and files. Lastly, it was Q&amp;A’s, evaluation, and monitoring. For this process, we gathered multiple peer reviews and feedback. There were many final touches and “Voila!!” our hard work was finally completed.</p>

<h2 id="my-experiences-and-what-i-now-know">My Experiences and What I Now Know</h2>

<p>Let me just say, I have gained a HUGE amount of respect for the software engineers out there! The amount of teamwork and peer review was very unexpected to me. In my personal opinion, I feel as though it takes more than just a teamwork to be a great software engineer. You need to be able to think critically, think as a team, learn how to cooperate and communicate with others, and most of all, you need connections. Whether that be to ask for help or for feedback, you need more than just your team and your skills. As many people say, you could even say that it takes a village. I also learned that there is much more to coding and applications that just web development. For example, coding is a huge part in AI and facial recognition. Even though those two things are very controversial right now, they would not be possible without the software engineers behind them.</p>
