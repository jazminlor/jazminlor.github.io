# UHUber
## Overview

**The Problem:** Many UH students most commonly commute to school via car or bus if they live off-campus. However, both have its cons. When driving to school via car, many students drive alone. With the rising costs of gas and parking permits, this can be a big issue to the students. When commuting via bus, this could be inefficient for students, because there is no exact or guaranteed time of arrival. Delays, traffic, and even commuting to the bus stop alone could be negative factors to taking the bus to school. 

**The Solution:** UHUber is an application for University of Hawaii students, allowing students to become drivers and riders to commute to school together, depending on their schedules and desired times. This application will not only save the students' time and money, but also the economy. 


## Mockup Page Ideas


- Landing page
- User home page
- Riders page
- Drivers page
- Add Rider page
- Add Driver page
- Admin home page
- Schedule page
- Add Schedule page
- Select Ride page
- Add Ride page


## Use Case Ideas


The Landing page will be the first page the user lands on. This will be the main website that will ask if you need a ride or is offering a ride. Then, once either option is clicked on, the user will be prompted to either log in or sign up. Notice that only UH Manoa students, staff, and faculty may use this application. They will be then re-directed to their User home page, which will be their profile, their schedule, and if they are offering or looking for rides. The Rider  page will consist of riders and their wanted times, whereas the Drivers page will consist of drivers and their offered times and locations. To become a rider or driver, that will be done on the Add Rider page or Add Driver page. To become a driver, admins will look at and approve of their licenses first. Admins have access to all pages, as well as the ability to delete users, roles. They can also do the opposite and add these. The Schedule page is where each user can see theirs and one another's schedules. To add a schedule, one will go to the Add Schedule page. Lastly, to actually ride with someone, a Rider or Driver will click on a selected ride based on location on the Select Ride page, and can add it using the Add Ride page.
