## JavaScript?! I Only Know of C++!


I have always heard of JavaScript, alongside with Java, to be one of the most well-known and popular programming languages used by many big name companies and brands. To my understanding, it is mainly used for design and web-page uses, such as making the web-pages interactive and making it look fancy.

However, before being introduced to JavaScript, the only programming language 
I was ever introduced to and worked with was C++. In my opinion, C++ was quite complex to work with. C++ required such tedious code, had difficult syntax to work with, and was overall not a good introduction to coding for me. I struggled especially a lot during the beginning, but once I started to understand how to code and why my codes were not working, it got much easier! It was growing on me quickly and I appreciated the choice of a difficult introduction language. 

**Spoiler Alert**: C++ is actually quite similar to JavaScript, which has been a huge help with my courses!


## What I Have Learned and Compared


After completing a brief yet thorough introduction to JavaScript and ES6 course, they use many of the same basic syntax. Not only that, but they are very similar to C++. I personally believe that understanding and writing JavaScript code is much, much simpler and easier than C++. Though, of course, C++ is the only thing I can even compare it to, because that is all that I know. 
JavaScript has many shortcuts, it is more pleasing to the eye, and again, it is just so much more simple and less cluttered. It does not even require a compiler to run! Due to these reasons, I have found a huge remark that JavaScript saves tremendous time. If you can learn its shortcuts and how to simplify code, it applies even more!


## JAVASCRIPT IS THE NEW BITCOIN! GET ON IT NOW!!


Just kidding. Although I believe that many and maybe even most programmers should know JavaScript and have experience with it, I do not believe it will take anyone far. At least not with just JavaScript under their hands. I believe that programmers should have a wide selection of different programming languages in order to do well and land a good, lifetime career. I really do like using JavaScript and I believe I will continue using it, even after college, but I do not think it is the strongest nor preferred language in many big companiesʻ eyes. I believe Java or Python are the real money-makers if you want to land a high-paying job. Still, I plan to continue using it, because it is just so simple and easy.


## Overview of ICS 314 and Athletic Software Engineering


This may be an unpopular opinion, but I actually like it! I really do enjoy how this ICS 314 course is structured and that athletic software engineering is used. I cannot even put to words how much I stress due to this course, but I know that if I just put the work into it and keep going, I will have at least tried and hopefully passed (even if just barely). Plus, on the bright side, it feels amazing when things finally click and I get the hang of things! It brings me back to when I was first introduced to coding; because I failed so much, I learned how to NOT fail. I learned the "whyʻs" and the "howʻs" of things. I struggle a lot with the practice WODs, but I learn more each time I do them. Not only that, but I also get more efficient. I believe that practice makes perfect, and with this courseʻs structure and style of learning, there will always be room for improvement. Therefore, I can firmly say that it will work for me.
