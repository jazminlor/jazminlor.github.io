## Let's Talk About Bootstrap 5

What even is Bootstrap 5? Bootstrap 5 is arguably the most popular free and open-source CSS framework for developing websites and apps. It includes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Typically, you can strictly use HTML and CSS to create a website, however, to make your life easier, it is highly advised to use Bootstrap 5. The difference between using Bootstrap 5 and only using HTML + CSS is that one will look much, much more appealing. With Bootstrap 5, you can add frames, create dropdown menus, menu buttons, icons, and much more. It is what makes a website so easy to use and it will attract more customers as well, due to the simplicity and looks. In my personal opinion, this is what a corporate or any big-name brands should already have implemented in their websites.

## My Ups and Downs With Bootstrap 5

If I am being honest, I have a LOT more downs than ups with using Bootstrap 5, however, I still highly suggest using it. Why in the world should "I" use it then, you may be asking yourself? The endgoal and its outcome with using it is so, so much more rewarding than not using it. In my opinion, it is even incomparable. It is a complete headache (at least to me) just trying to understand my own code and remembering certain variables or icons, but that is also why I recommend using Bootstrap 5's website as a guide. 

## What The Future Holds

Currently, I am still not fully confident on what I would like to do as far as my career goes. For the rest of my time here at UH, I would like to delve in web-design, game-design, and other concentrations. I believe I still have lots to explore! I am aiming to become a software developer after college, but I am unsure of what the future will hold. If not software engineering, I would like to become a data analyst. Analyzing data and solving problems using web applications and programs, in particular, interest me. I guess you could even call me the nerd type! I would even settle to do anything web-related and computer-based.
