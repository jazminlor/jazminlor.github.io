## My Take On Coding Standards

In your eyes, what makes a good code? Some say a "good" code is code that can run and perform or accurately gives you the input you were looking for. However, to me personally, I think a good code is code that can be read easily with little to no effort. That means formatting your code, making sure it looks neat, and is easy to read. If a colleague were to look at my code, they would easily understand it. It would be in an instant to spot an error or see how I got my solutions. This past week, we used a new IDE to code. Coding with ESLint with IntelliJ made me very familiar with the error messages. I used to use Visual Studios for coding, and it would also give me error messages just about the same way. The errors were very quick to catch on and it was easy to identify what I did wrong and how I could solve it.
