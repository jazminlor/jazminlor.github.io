## Prior to Javascript

I have always heard of JavaScript, alongside with Java, to be one of the most well-known and popular programming languages used by many big name companies and brands. To my understanding, it is mainly used for design and web-page uses, such as making the web-pages interactive and making it look fancy. However, before being introduced to JavaScript, the only programming language 
I was ever introduced to and worked with was C++. In my opinion, C++ was quite complex to work with. C++ required such tedious code, had difficult syntax to work with, and was overall not a good introduction to coding for me. I struggled especially a lot during the beginning, but once I started to understand how to code and why my codes were not working, it got much easier! 
It was growing on me quickly and I appreciated the choice of a difficult introduction language. Spoiler Alert: C++ is actually quite similar to JavaScript, which has been a huge help my courses!
