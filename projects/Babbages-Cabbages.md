To give a clue with how this code was made, here are the required functions that were used:

Here, a program was to be made that collected the inputs of a personʻs first and last name, their hourly rate, the number of hours they worked that week. Then, it computed and displayed their full name, their hours, the hourly rate, gross pay, taxes, deductions, and their net pay.I completed this program from start to finish for a project for a previous ICS course. This course was taken from a local college in the U.S. mainland that was heavily reliant on C++.

Although this took me ages to complete, I learned much more than I could have asked for. As you can tell, there are LOTS of functions required. This was an introductory course, so the reason why it took so many functions, was so that it broke down the program into multiple sub-programs. It made it much easier to understand exactly what I was doing and what the next steps were.
