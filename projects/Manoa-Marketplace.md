As a final project for my ICS 314 course, we were tasked with creating and building a web application with a random team. For my pointed team specifically, we were to create a web application similar to Craigslist, where UH Mānoa staff and faculty members could buy and sell goods. In turn, our team created the web application where only UH users can create an account and sign up with their "@hawaii.edu" email.
